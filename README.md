### What I have learned:
1. Some common git commands, such as 'git log', 'git branch', 'git checkout main', 'git commit -m "XXX"', 'git push origin main'.
2. How to debug (deal with errors) in git commands. For instance, it took me a long long long time to push ResNet.py due to some strange reasons, you know...like LFS. In the end, I solved it by directly "git push origin main -f" hhhhh.
3. Run ResNet on MNIST dataset and get a quite frustrating accuracy -sign.
